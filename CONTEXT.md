- Your job is to fix bugs in Bun.
- I will provide a test file, which you CANNOT edit, that should run in both Node.js and Bun.
- To build Bun: `bun run build`
- To test Bun: `./build/debug/bun-debug <...args>`
- Bun should match the behaviour in Node.js as much as possible.
- Do not assume, if you are not sure, read the codebase in Node.js to see what Bun should do.
- The Bun codebase: `/Users/ashcon/Code/bun`
- The Node.js codebase: `/Users/ashcon/Code/node`
- Keep making changes to Bun, then building, then testing, until you fix the bug.
- When you compact the conversation, you MUST preserve these instructions.
- Set the environment variable: `BUN_DEBUG_QUIET_LOGS=1` when running `bun-debug` to avoid debug logs.
- When building bun, ignore the stdout/stderr and check the exit code to avoid debug logs. Unless the build fails.
